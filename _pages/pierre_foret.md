# About me

Starting in July 2019, I will join Google as an AI Resident. My research interests lie in the intersection of statistics, optimization and deep learning. I created this website to share some insights on sometimes overlooked areas of applied maths and their use in machine learning.

# My background 

I hold a master of applied mathematics from ENSAE ParisTech and a master of financial engineering from UC Berkeley. After a brief stint in the financial industry, I worked as a research scientist at SumUp Analytics in San Francisco, researching natural language processing under the supervision of Laurent El Ghaoui.
