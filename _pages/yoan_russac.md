# About

I graduated from [ENSAE ParisTech](http://www.ensae.fr) where I studied statistics and probability theory.
I am also a graduate from the [MVA](http://cmla.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-anglaise/academics/mva-master-degree-227777.kjsp) master where I majored in Machine Learning.
Since december 2018, I have started my PhD at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris 
where I am working on Bandits models and Online Learning under the supervision of 
[Olivier Cappé](https://www.di.ens.fr/~cappe/) and 
[Aurélien Garivier](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~agarivie/?q=node/34).
