# About

I graduated from ENSAE ParisTech where I studied statistics and probability theory.
I am also a graduate from the MVA master where I majored in Machine Learning.
Since december 2018, I have started my PhD at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris 
where I am working on Bandits models and Online Learning under the supervision of 
Olivier Cappé and Aurélien Garivier.
